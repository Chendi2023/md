**Step 1**: Review API Documentation

To get started, go to the DataCloud System API Portal in the Anypoint Exchange and review the available documentation. This documentation provides essential details for connecting to and interacting with **accounts**, **aeras**, **orders**, **surveys**, and **webAccounts** objects.

**Step 2**: Request API Access for Your Application

To begin using the API, you must first register your application. At the top of the DataCloud System API Portal page, click the “Request API access” button.

Then, either:

1. Select an existing application (if you have previously requested access for other APIs),

or

2. Register a **new application** to obtain access.

For further instructions, please refer to [How to Request Access?](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-exchange/to-request-access).

**Step 3**: Access Approval

Your request will be reviewed, and once approved, you will receive an email with access information. This email will include a link to the Developer Portal where you can retrieve your **client ID** and **client secret**. These credentials will be required for authenticating and authorizing your API calls.
